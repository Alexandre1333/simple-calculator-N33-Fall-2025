Made the InputConverter class static, same with the CalculatorEngine library class. Help text changed to add the new operators added, all the base 4 plus modulus. Used stringbuilder to make sure our result,
is trimmed to a precision of 2 decimal values. Moved the CalculatorClass into its own project and into a library class.
